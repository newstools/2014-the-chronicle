With auditions for Zimbabwe’s representative at Africa’s most popular TV reality show – Big Brother Africa (BBA) taking place in Harare today, the euphoria of extravaganza lifestyle has already gripped those taking part in the competition.
For eight seasons, the show has captivated viewers with its mixture of scandals, fights, tension and romance. For 91 days from September 7, Africa will get a chance to see its sons and daughters light up its screens as they vie for the $300,000 cash prize up for grabs. When the show premiered on African screens in 2003, it was an alien concept to many and as such it was greeted with a chorus of discontent. Many felt it had the potential to negatively portray the African people. It was believed by some to fly in the face of values that have guided the people of the continent for years. Although it is still criticised in some quarters, Big Brother is now largely an accepted phenomenon and this has been confirmed by the royal welcome granted to one of the country’s representatives – Munya Chidzonga by President Mugabe. What this means is that the show is now recognised by the highest office in the land. While viewers look forward to another season of debauchery, verbal mudslinging, friendship and companionship that every season of the show brings, there are some that aspire to be in the thick of the action. Participation in the show has become a lucrative opportunity for both celebrities and ordinary folk alike, with many eager to reap the benefits of what the 91 days in front of Africa brings. While coming first and walking away with the jackpot is the ultimate aim, participation on its own is a lucrative incentive. Many have left the show with fame that they could not have envisioned a few months prior to their stay in the house. However, a note of caution should be given to those that wish to represent the country in this year’s show. While the fruits of participation in the show can be immense, participation can also have similarly monumental drawbacks. Not all who leave their country for BBA come back having earned glory. Instead of a warm embrace when they disembark from South African Airways at the Harare International Airport after their sojourn, they might be greeted by scowls and the gnashing of teeth. Pros 
One of the advantages of participating in the show is the instant fame that it generates for the participant. If one “plays the game well” — as the show’s housemates like to say, one can become an overnight superstar known to legions of fans across the continent. Due to the nature of the show, a person does not have 15 minutes of fame but is given an opportunity to steal the spotlight as the show is a 24-hour spectacle, whose cameras do not wander far from any housemate. Another feature that makes the show an ideal opportunity for celebrities is that it has the power to boost careers. Most run down celebrities, especially artistes who have participated in Big Brother, have been able to market their skills to the rest of the continent and continued doing so even after the show. Roki’s song Chidzoka, despite being fairly old locally, was afforded a new lease of life on the continent as it proved a hit with the housemates in the show’s 7th season where he was a participant. Munya Chidzonga’s acting career blossomed after his stay in the house. Pokello Nare on the other hand saw her shoe sales business booming as people wanted to be associated with her brand. BBA can be used as a platform to clean one’s battered image – just like Pokello did. She entered the House with many viewing her as a porn star after her sex tape was leaked to the public – months before she entered the house. But when she walked out, she was a heroine as she managed to show people she was not as bad as they believed she was by ignoring advances made to her by male housemates. If one impresses sufficiently on the show, it is not surprising for them to become a permanent fixture on African screens. Zimbabwe’s Vimbai Mutinhiri, Nigeria’s Uti Nwachukwu, Nick Wang’ondu and Uganda’s Gaetano have built on the fame that the show gave to them as they are now successful presenters of various shows aired on DStv. Cons
Due to the show’s nature, where participants are isolated from the public – it is easy for them to fall victim to the temptations that the show offers. BBA has no stiff rules as anything goes on the show. One is free to do as they please. In past seasons, the show’s female characters have fallen victim to this freedom as they are used by male housemates to please their sexual needs. Most women who have been sexually active while in the house have been victimised by fans of the show who label them “whores”. Africa is still largely a conservative society and dancing outside the boundaries of what is thought to be proper behaviour can get one into trouble. While the male always comes out more popular from a sexual experience on the show, there are usually no points awarded to the female for her role in the escapade. Zambia’s Talia who participated in season seven became demonised being called “loose”. She was shunned be her country when she returned home. Privacy is another issue of importance. The day you step into the BBA house is the day your privacy ends as you become social property. Everything you do, even when you return home will always be in the public eye. The show also gets people interested in your family and their issues, something some parents may not necessarily like. Conflict with a fellow countryman, especially a popular one, can turn any participant from a hero to villain. Zimbabwe’s Maneta came back home a villain for her role in getting the popular Roki evicted from the show. While Roki landed home to a hero’s welcome, Maneta was snubbed by people in most parts of the country she visited and was never able to reap the benefits of her participation in the show. She also had to sneak into the country for fear of being attacked by angry fans. Kenya’s Prezzo was vilified by people from the different corners of the continent for his treatment of his late girlfriend, the Nigerian singer, Goldie and other women on the show. Although he came second on the show, he was never able to launch his music career across the continent as he would have wished. As the country’s celebrities vie for the public’s attention, it may be prudent for them to note that participation on its own does not matter. How one conducts themselves and represents their country determines whether they will have a happy stay in the house and live happily afterwards. BBA is screened 24/7 meaning people are screened naked as they are bathing for Shower Hour filming. People may forget how your body looked like but Google never forgets. It will keep those screenshots which will have been captured by fans to humiliate you and whenever your children Google your name, they will certainly bump into those pictures and all the embarrassing moments housemates will have had during BBA. If you are one who does not know much about their country and its history, you better not attempt entering the show as those who show little knowledge of their country are always unpopular when they return like Maneta. The decision to go for BBA is not an easy one. Many have lost their jobs for their decisions to be part of the show. You may lose your job and be the first one to be evicted and end up a loser at the end of the day.
